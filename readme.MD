# API Tool for Path of Exile
## Shows error you try to call the API too often

Just a very simple tool.
Usage:

* Put in a number in miliseconds and hit the button
* If it says that it's ok the number is valid and it doesn't throw error
* If it calls the api too often a timer 30 seconds start then you can try new number
